# CPU scheduling simultation

Simulate the CPU scheduling in an operating system with different data structures.

Algorithms to compare:
- First-come, first serve (or first-in, first out)
- Round robin (with different quantum size)
- Shortest job first (non-preemptive)
- Shortest job first (preemptive)
